This was originally the project that helped me learn Python!
Now, I'm returning to it because
  
* The code is embarrassing
* I want to use it as a way to learn how to scrape *properly*

## Objectives

- [X] Fix errors caused by an update to the website
- [X] Scrape using library -> Beautiful Soup was chosen
- [X] Scrape to *proper* json (i.e. using **KEYS** not ordered lists...)
- [X] Compress output file
